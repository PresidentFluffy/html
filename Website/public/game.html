              <p class="text-grey">At its core, Tetris is a deceptively simple game that challenges players to manipulate a series of geometric shapes, known as tetrominoes, as they fall from the top of the playing field.</p>
              <p class="text-grey">The goal is to arrange the tetrominoes into complete rows without any gaps, causing the completed rows to disappear and earn points.</p>
              <p class="text-grey">As the game progresses, the tetrominoes fall faster and faster, increasing the difficulty and requiring players to think quickly and strategically to keep pace.</p><br>

              <p class="text-grey">But perhaps the most compelling aspect of Tetris is its ability to tap into the universal human desire for order and accomplishment.</p>
              <p class="text-grey">There's something deeply satisfying about clearing rows and watching the playing field clear, creating a sense of progress and achievement that keeps players hooked for hours on end.</p><br>
              <p class="text-grey">In addition to its addictive gameplay and universal appeal, Tetris has also had a profound impact on the world of gaming and popular culture.</p>

              <h2><b>Ms. Pac-Man</b></h2>
            
            <p class="text-grey">Ms. Pac-Man, a timeless classic in the world of gaming, emerged in 1982 as a sequel to the immensely popular Pac-Man.</p>

            <p class="text-grey">At its core, Ms. Pac-Man retains the simple yet compelling gameplay mechanics of the original Pac-Man. Players control the titular character, Ms. Pac-Man, as she navigates mazes filled with pellets, power pellets, and ghosts.</p>
            <p class="text-grey">The objective remains unchanged: gobble up all the pellets while avoiding the ghosts.</p>
            <p class="text-grey">However, Ms. Pac-Man introduces several enhancements that take the gameplay to the next level.</p><br>

            <p class="text-grey">Furthermore, Ms. Pac-Man introduces new ghost behaviors, adding depth and complexity to the gameplay.</p>
            <p class="text-grey">The ghosts, now named Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Sue, exhibit more advanced AI patterns, making them more unpredictable and challenging to evade.</p>
            <p class="text-grey">This dynamic AI system ensures that no two playthroughs are exactly alike, providing endless replay value for players.</p><br>
            <p class="text-grey">In addition to its innovative gameplay mechanics, Ms. Pac-Man also boasts vibrant graphics, catchy music, and charming character animations that enhance the overall experience.</p>
